### A. <a id="Abstract">ABSTRACT</a>

This proposal recommends the implementation of a relational database to meet the growing needs of Seamus Company (SC) and to increase the market share by allowing SC to take advantage of customer data they already possess. The goals of this project are to Implement a new Relational Database System through the design of a relational model of data, creation of database, and setting up the cloud storage. Kyle Corp is the best company to be trusted with implementing this solution because we are not only competitive on price but also in time. This will cost about $17,000 and will take Kyle Corp about 5 weeks to complete.

#### B1. <a id="Propsed-Solution">PROPOSED SOLUTION </a>

Kyle Corp is pleased to provide to Seamus Company (SC) the following setup, installation, and implementation of a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), called Microsoft SQL Server 21 (SQL Server). In addition to the RDBMS, we will use Microsoft cloud infrastructure to make it easier for you to scale as the business grows. This keeps costs lower than running and maintaining a physical server. The introduction of an RDBMS into SC’s business environment will increase the market share in the publishing space by enabling SC to: make high-value inferences with customer data, predict customer behavior, provide additional tools for employees of SC to expand on their analyses. Implementing a Relational Model  of data enforces the integrity of the data while reducing redundant data. The RDBMS does this by creating relationships between the different tables in the database. As it stands now, your data management system lacks the ability to do basic queries, cannot create large data lakes for exploratory data analysis, and has no referential integrity between tables of data. 
Kyle Corp will supply the resources required to implement a new relational data management system. The entire process will take a month and includes phases that will assessment the data management needs of SC, evaluate alternative systems, implement the RDBMS, and evaluate the results of the process. According to Microsoft’s white paper on SQL Server, they estimate that creating an ETL  process lags two-to-seven (2-7) days behind the SQL Server system which is eighty percent (80%) slower in most cases (Microsoft 21). The main goal of Kyle Corps’ proposal to Seamus Corp is to ensure you stay ahead in the world of data and increase your market share.  

#### B2. <a id="Related-Works-Review"> RELATED WORKS REVIEW </a>
The First document used in the development of this proposal was a technical white paper called, Microsoft SQL Server 21. This document describes the changing world of data and ways to use that data in today’s data driven economy. According to Microsoft, businesses must use data to make informed business decisions to stay relevant and competitive in today’s fast-growing business environment (Microsoft, 21). This article applies to my proposed solution because it helps explain the relational database management improvements as compared to a current flat-file database infrastructure currently used. This document discusses on a high level different types of analyses, enhanced security, and industry-leading performance you get from using Microsoft SQL Server (Microsoft, 21).

The second artifact I reviewed was is a book titled, Relational Database Design and Implementation, which included information on how to intelligently design and implement a relational database. 

<a id="Figure-1"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/1s0NCXX/Picture2.jpg" alt="Implementation" border="0"> </a>

Contained within is a diagram that displays the implementation process for a relational database, see Figure 1 (Harrington, 2009). The significance of artifact is the framework is supplied; as well as the addition of the framework allows the team and staff at SC to have an overview of the implementation phases. 
The third and final related works review is about an article posted on Forbes titled, Big Data Goes Big. This article is directed at the executive level personnel at companies which gives me helpful numeric metrics to use to explain my reasoning. According to the document, after speaking to 300 IT executives and decision makers about their take on analytics, the consensus is that 90 percent (90%) of them plan to increase their spending on BI  and Analytics (Kulkarni, 21). This shows the need for SC to update to be able to keep up with other companies moving forward. 

#### B3. <a id="Related-Works-Review"> GOALS, OBJECTIVES, AND DELIVERABLES </a>

##### I. GOAL 1: IMPLEMENT NEW DATABASE SYSTEM 
The primary goal of this project is to assess, evaluate, plan, and implement a relational database system for Seamus Company (SC) to increase market share in the publishing industry. This system must be well thought out and be customized to SC’s various departments to meet their specific needs. Kyle Corp will also be setting up useful cloud storage infrastructure that will be helpful to SC as the data needs grow. There will be varying levels of access to ensure that the system is secure. SC should note that supplementary staff is needed for support and administration of the new system must also be considered. The project can be broken down into four (4) objectives, each encompassing a marker to measure the successful completion of each objective. Kyle Corp will be using a linear project management approach called Waterfall Methodology  to ensure successful completion of the project.  

###### A.	OBJECTIVE: ASSESS NEEDS  

Before the new database can be implemented, Kyle Corp will be charged with assessing the needs of Seamus Company in terms of data. The considerations will include the ownership of the data, current database architecture, and the feasibility of a new system as opposed to continuing with the current system. This will include quantitative and qualitative measures the include two (2) deliverables to mark the successful completion of this objective.  

1.	DELIVERABLE: PREPARE A SYSTEMS ANALYSIS DOCUMENT
To complete the systems analysis document, you must conduct an observation of the current system. You do this by looking at how people currently interact with the excel spreadsheets that make up the flat-file database system and by having staff members complete a questionnaire about their thoughts on the old system. Special considerations must be paid to the technical, financial, operational feasibility. 

2.	DELIVERABLE: PREPARE A REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT
Creating a use case diagram to aid in the development of the requirements for the system. One of the benefits of formalizing the requirements is that we will be able to see how people will interact with the database and also the relationships that will need to be established between the tables for referential integrity and limiting the redundancy of the data. Another benefit is that the requirements gathered will be how we measure the success of the project, so it is important to document these for the validation process later in the project.  

###### B.	OBJECTIVE: EVALUATE ALTERNATIVE SYSTEMS 
The completion of this objective will inform the decision relating to the management system is going to be best for Seamus Company. Included in this objective are the entity relationship diagram (ER Diagram ). Each of the two (2) deliverables provide us with options to be able to compare between the choices that we have available. The development of the ER Diagram (See Figure 2) will also be important in designing the Relational Database because we will use that to develop the Logical and Physical infrastructure of the database. 

<a id="Figure-2"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/2tCMFcK/Picture1.jpg" alt="Picture1" border="0"></a>

1.	DELIVERABLE: COST- BENEFIT ANALYSIS 
The cost benefit analysis is a simple analysis that will aid in the decision-making process in terms of how it will financially impact SC. Included in the cost benefit analysis will be a high, medium, and low-end alternatives from SQL Server.

2.	DELIVERABLE: CHOOSING AN ALTERNATIVE
We will create an entity relationship diagram in this step for us to be able to see visually how the system will look. Based on that information we decide which alternative is the one we want to implement. Considerations include the use-case diagram, the requirements document, and the ER diagram. 

###### C.	OBJECTIVE: IMPLEMENT THE SYSTEM 
Using the ER Diagram, we will create a normalized schema to prototype the data and make sure everything is going to look like it should. We will also need to consider things like how users will interact with the database and develop the back end of the project. We need to make sure that our data will be put in the Azure cloud storage correctly. 

1.	DELIVERABLE: PROTOTYPING 
We will make a form in this step to make sure that the data will be put into the Azure cloud storage correctly. We will also normalize all the data to at least 3rd Normal Form while remembering that there is a marketing, sales, and supply management, and security department that needs to be able to interact with the form on the front end. 

2.	DELIVERABLE: DEVELOP AND TEST SYSTEM 
In this deliverable we will complete the objecting of implementing the system by using SQL Data Definition Language which defines the different structures in the database. We will be able to create, modify, and remove database objects as prescribed by the requirements of the database. We will be able to specify the types of data for each table and create indexes for easy access of the data. 

###### D.	OBJECTIVE: EVALUATE THE SYSTEM 
The evaluation of the database management system will be the last phase needed to meet the goal of this project. This is the part of the project where we will look at how well the database performs, evaluate the requirements, and make any changes to the system if it does not meet requirements. 

1.	DELIVERABLE: BENCHMARK THE SYSTEM 
There are certain benchmarks that the system must meet in terms of speed. The benchmarks will be compared to the old system to show the improvement. We have to formalize this process because the next step will be to evaluate the requirements to make sure that they are all met. 

2.	DELIVERABLE: REQUIREMENTS VALIDATION
The requirements validation is the last part of the project. We will meet the last objective by the completion of this portion of the project. We will make sure that all of the requirements outlined in a previous section of the project will be met. We will formalize this in a document and then make sure that everything lines up. Any requirement that is not fulfilled will require that we go back and fix what is not met. 

 
### B4. <a id="Projected-Timeline"> PROJECTED TIMELINE</a>

| Description of Milestone or Deliverable | Duration | Anticipated Start Date (MM/DD/YY) | Anticipated End Date (MM/DD/YY) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prepare a Systems Analysis Document  | 7.5 Days  | 11/01/21  | 1/08/  |
| Gather Requirements  | 1 Day  | 11/08/21  | 11/09/21  |
| Prepare a Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)  | 3-5 Days  | 11/11/21  | 11/15/21 |
| Choose an Alternative  |  3 Hours | 11/18/21  | 11/18/21  |
| ER Diagram  | 8 Hours  | 11/18/21  | 11/19/21  |
|  Physical Infrastructure Diagram  | 8 Hours  | 11/19/21  | 11/20/21  |
| Develop  | 8 Hours | 11/21/21 | 11/22/21 |
| Test the Benchmarks | 5 Days | 11/22/21 | 11/27/21  |
| Requirements Validation | 2 Days | 11/28/21 | 11/30/21 |


			 
#### B5. <a id="Resources-and-Costs"> RESOURCES AND COSTS</a>

| Description | Unit Cost (USD) | Quantity  | Duration  | Total (USD) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SQL Server Standard License  | $931 plus $209 per user  | 3  | N/A  | $1,558 |
| Azure Storage Account  | $19.44 per 1,000 GB  | 25  | N/A  | $486 |
|  Design and Setup (Labor) | $10,000  | 1  | 1.25 Months  | $10,000 |
|  Contingency | N/A  | 1   | N/A  | $5,000 |
|   |   |  Total |  | $17,044  |

This is an affordable project. The most expensive part of this project is paying for the license from Microsoft for SQL Server 21 and Azure cloud services. I was able to arrive at the costs by looking up how much an enterprise license costs to use an instance of SQL Server and then looking up the costs for storage in the cloud service provided by Microsoft.  
 
#### B6. <a id="Outcome"> OUTCOME </a>
As specified in the requirements validation project in the last phase of the project once the Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is live and meets all the requirements gathered in the beginning of the project. The proposed solution of an RDBMS will have been implemented according the specifications agreed up by both Kyle Corps and Seamus Company.
	
The first metric that will be measured is the assessment of the current system. The metric of this portion of the project will be the completion of the deliverables in the first objective. The next metric that is going to be measured is the implementation of the system. Kyle Corp will measure this by making sure it is up and running. The final metric to measure the success of this project is the requirements validation document. After that is completed it will mark the success of the project and the project will be successfully completed.

| Metric  | What Will Be Measured  |  Success Metric | 
|---|---|---|
| Assess Needs  | The current database needs of the company  | The completion of the systems analysis document |   
| Implement System  | The creation of the Relational Database  | The completion of the final deliverable  |  
| Evaluate the Implemented System  | The successful completion of the project  |  The Requirements Validation Document |

#### C. <a id="Justification-and-Proposal-Highlights"> JUSTIFICATION AND PROPOSAL HIGHLIGHTS</a>

This proposal recommends the implementation of a relational database to meet the growing needs of Seamus Company (SC). Currently, SC needs to gain market share in the publishing space and using a relational database management system (RDBMS) will be able to help SC do just that. Using a RDBMS is the current industry standard for businesses of all sizes that want to maximize profits. To be competitive and to not fall behind the newly dubbed Data Economy it is important to have a database system that ensures the security and the integrity of your data while allowing for useful insights to be made (Microsoft, 21). 
The outcomes of this project include the assessment, implementation, and evaluation process that Kyle Corp can provide in a single month. We provide quantitative measures that are specific and unique to Seamus Corp so you will be able to measure the success and progress of the entire project. At Kyle Corp, our efficient process allows us to deliver a product for only $17,044. That is significantly lower than our next competition. Kyle Corp is the company to enlist to ensure the successful completion of this project.
